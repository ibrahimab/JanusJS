JanusJS
========

This is a wrapper library for the Janus Plugins. Right now it is in beta, as I need to make further adjustments and make the code more extendible. The goal of this library is to eventually support all the Janus plugins, but right now it only supports the SIP plugin. There is also a (temporary) dependency required for this code to work and that is the Janus SIP javascript file that comes with Janus itself. I will eventually integrate that dependency into this library.
